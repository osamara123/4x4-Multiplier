# Smart Temperature System (ON PIC 16F877A)

The aim of this project is to design a smart temperature system for a room in apartement using Microcontroller to control three fans based on temperature sensor (LM 35). 7-segment bit is added to the system and connected to to ports of the microcontroller to show temperature value.
